Logos RGB Matrix Backpack firmware, examples and docs
---------------------------

With the default firmware, this backpack is a board for driving 8x8 common anode RGB LED matrices from the I2C bus.

Remember that firmware memory is precious - you have *2 KB* of EEPROM and *128 bytes* of SRAM to work with on the backpack itself.

**Compilers:**

* AVR firmware is compiled with [WinAVR v20100110](http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/)

* Examples are compiled with [the Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software)
